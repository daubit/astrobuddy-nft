# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

``yarn deploy --network mumbai; npx hardhat uploadAll --network mumbai; npx hardhat mint --network mumbai --seasonid 1 --to 0x06F6b8f8ac59957BA693f7A6C5a00E734c5ecD53``
